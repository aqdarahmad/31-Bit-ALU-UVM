⚙️ ALU Verification Project using UVM
🧩 Overview

This project implements a Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench to verify an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) design.
The ALU supports multiple operations such as:

Addition ➕

Subtraction ➖

AND operation 🟩

OR operation 🟨

XOR operation 🟪

The testbench generates randomized transactions to test all ALU functionalities and ensure correctness using UVM components such as:

sequence_item, driver, monitor, agent, scoreboard, and subscriber

🧾 📊 Simulation Report Summary

Below is the official UVM simulation log summary generated by Cadence Xcelium after running the ALU verification environment:

--- UVM Report catcher Summary ---

Number of demoted UVM_FATAL reports  :    0
Number of demoted UVM_ERROR reports  :    0
Number of demoted UVM_WARNING reports:    0
Number of caught UVM_FATAL reports   :    0
Number of caught UVM_ERROR reports   :    0
Number of caught UVM_WARNING reports :    0

--- UVM Report Summary ---

** Report counts by severity
UVM_INFO    : 2505
UVM_WARNING :    1
UVM_ERROR   :    0
UVM_FATAL   :    0

** Report counts by id
[CBUNREG]            : 1
[CDNS_EXT]           : 1
[MONITOR]            : 501
[RNTST]              : 1
[TEST_DONE]          : 1
[alu_driver]         : 1000
[alu_random_test]    : 1
[alu_scoreboard]     : 500
[alu_sequence]       : 500

Simulation complete via $finish(1) at time 10 us + 49

🧠 Explanation of the Results
🔖 Field	💡 Meaning
UVM_INFO	Informational messages from different UVM components (everything worked fine).
UVM_WARNING	One minor warning, usually harmless (like unregistered callback or unused variable).
UVM_ERROR / UVM_FATAL	Both are 0, meaning simulation passed successfully ✅
[alu_driver], [alu_sequence], [alu_scoreboard]	These indicate your UVM components were running correctly.
Simulation complete via $finish	The test finished cleanly at simulation time = 10 microseconds.
🎯 Interpretation

✅ All tests passed successfully
⚙️ ALU environment executed 500 random transactions
🧩 No errors or mismatches detected by the scoreboard
📘 One warning only — simulation stability is excellent

🧪 Simulation Command

To run the UVM testbench with Cadence Xcelium (xrun), use the following command:

xrun -sv -uvm -access +rw \
     alu.sv \
     alu_interface.sv \
     alu_sequence_item.sv \
     alu_driver.sv \
     alu_monitor.sv \
     alu_sequencer.sv \
     alu_agent.sv \
     alu_scoreboard.sv \
     alu_subscriber.sv \
     alu_environment.sv \
     alu_add_sequence.sv \
     alu_sub_sequence.sv \
     alu_and_sequence.sv \
     alu_or_sequence.sv \
     alu_xor_sequence.sv \
     alu_sequence.sv \
     alu_random_test.sv \
     testbench.sv \
     -debug_opts verisium_interactive


✅ Note:

Make sure each file has a proper timescale directive (e.g., `timescale 1ns/1ps).

Ensure your working directory includes all the .sv files.

The test name is alu_random_test.

📊 Coverage & Results

Functional Coverage: Collected through alu_subscriber.sv.

Scoreboard Checks: Validates actual vs expected ALU outputs.

Randomization: Achieved through UVM sequences for stress testing.
